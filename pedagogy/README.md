#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 This experiment contains the circuit of log and antilog amplifier using op-amp. Firstly, user will connect diodes, supply, ground and resistances with operational amplifier in order to complete the circuit for log/antilog amplifier. If the circuit is properly connected then user have to apply a particular value of input voltage and then observe the corresponding output. User can also vary the input voltage value to get different outputs in each simulator for log/antilog amplifier. After varying 5 input voltage values user can observe the plot between input and output voltages for both log and antilog amplifier.<br>
